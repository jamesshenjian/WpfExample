# WpfExample

This repo is created by following tutorial at https://caliburnmicro.com/documentation/Tutorials/WPF/Contents with slight differences<br><br>

<ul>
<li>ViewModel and View files don't have to be in the ViewModels Views directory. CM can find them.</li>
<li><local:MyBootstrapper x:Key="bootstrapper" />  what's after local: must be the bootstrapper class name.  x:key is not relevant as long as it's unique.</li>
 </ul>
