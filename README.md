This repo is created by following tutorial at https://caliburnmicro.com/documentation/Tutorials/WPF/Contents with slight differences

ViewModel and View files don't have to be in the ViewModels Views directory. CM can find them.
<local:MyBootstrapper x:Key="bootstrapper" />  what's after local: must be the bootstrapper class name.  x:key is not relevant as long as it's unique.
